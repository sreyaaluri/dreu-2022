After talking to Dr. Short about my tools and interests, she shared a few papers around shared autonomy and collaborative manipulation with me to narrow down my interest even more and get me started on thinking about my specific research quesiton. At first I was too caught up in higher level thinking about whether to get into shared autonomy or collaborative manipulation but Dr. Short guided me to focus more on decided what aspect of the human/robot I really want to focus on (gestures, gaze, language, haptics etc.). After reading the papers Dr. Short shared, papers that cite those papers, and papers that are referenced in them, I eventually decided on gaze. It seems like a hard problem and that is exciting!
