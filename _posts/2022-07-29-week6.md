From the past weeks I have noticed that I am really good with quickly picking up technical tools, but face quite a bit of friction when it comes to reading and writing. So, this week I have been advised to think about when I read, write, and code best and how to consistently incorporate all of them into my schedule. 

I have been overthinking how to read as I kept focussing on just understanding the nitty gritty details within a paper. I forgot to focus on actually deconstructing the paper, questioning it, asking why, and keep track of the bigger picture across papers. This became evident in my meeting with Dr. Short when she asked me to give a synthesis of the literature I had read and I could only think of how to give a brief overview of the papers individually. Dr. Short helped me break down the goal from the vague "think about a research question around gaze" to specfically looking for trends across the papers that I can note and/or question. This will truly help me build a research question.

I spent most of my week reading with sythesizing literature as a goal in mind and spent some of my time thinking about how to structure the ros nodes for intent communication through gaze tracking and actual robot motion. As a bonus, I also got to ask Dr. Short a lot of questions about applying to graduate school which was extremely helpful!
