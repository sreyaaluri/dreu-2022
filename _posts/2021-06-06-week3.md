This week I learned to work with vector data in python. This includes:
1. How shape files work (they store vector data)
3. How to read a shape file using geopandas
4. Extracting spatial information
5. Plotting using earthpy
6. How to import CSV file as shapefile
7. How to show multiple features in one plot with legend
8. How to perform calculations on various features
9. Cropping a raster based on the extent of vector data
10. Plotting raster data and vector data together

With this I think I have gotten a good handle on how to work with geospatial data in python using various python libraries. Next week I will start working on understanding Machine Learning!

Meanwhile at my university, all the faculty and math/cs students are now vaccinated, so they started holding more activities together!
- Tuesday evenings are for board game nights hosted by the math/cs department faculty
- Wednesday lunches all computer science students and faculty get together for lunch
- Thursday evenings all on-campus research students play volleyball

Side note: Not having to think about homework over the weekends has been _really_ nice.
