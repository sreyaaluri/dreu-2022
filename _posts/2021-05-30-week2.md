This week I learned to work with raster data in python. This includes:
1. How to read raster data stored in a GeoTIFF file using rasterio and rioxarray
2. Plotting raster data using pyplot
3. How to extract important spatial information from the GeoTIFF file
4. How to work with no data values
5. What reprojecting is, why it is important, and how to do it using rasterio
6. Working with multi-band rasters and performing calculations with multiple rasters
7. Exporting rasters with spatial information and metadata included in GeoTIFF file
8. Advanced plotting including classifying data and using lengeds

The idea for a secondary DREU research team was well received, however, it will take some time to figure out how to make it work as there are people in different research periods and different time zones. While that process is underway, my big struggle of staying on task for 8 hours a day while I was alone at a desk persisted.

Luckily for me, there is in-person research going on at my university and I live close-by, so I spoke to a couple professors in the Computer Science and Math department at the University of Richmond and they were happy to have me work alongside their research teams. So, I will be working at the university and joining the activities that students doing on-campus research participate in!
