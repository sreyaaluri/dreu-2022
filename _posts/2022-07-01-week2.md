Dr. Short and the PhD students went to the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/"> RSS </a> conference this week and I got to spend some time at the <a href="https://ceeo.tufts.edu/">Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>! Favourite quote from my time at the CEEO "you're reading in a mechie lab!?" - Dr. Chris Rogers. They had lots of fun stuff going on there and I loved talking to people who were approaching almost every task they were doing with pedagogy in mind. One group was designing a course and were having a tough time finding a good tutorial for setting up a virtual machine on their Mac so they <a href="https://katewujciak.wixsite.com/projectcreate">made their own tutorial</a>! I dislocated my kneecap last weekend so I ended up staying at home a lot and decided to cope by getting a LOT of technical work done. This week I...
1. Built a basic ROS project from onboarding
2. Learned about Markov Decision Processes
3. Learned the basics of Reinforcement Learning via <a href="https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/nyjbcRQ-uQ8"> DeepLizard's course</a>.
4. Learned about Q-Learning from <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/q-learning-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/">sentdex</a>
5. Set up <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/">MediaPipe</a> for pose recognition to control robot pose

Feeling really pumped and drained at the same time after time week!
